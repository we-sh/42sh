/*
** This is a template for a builtin implementation
** `BLTIN_CB_BEFORE`
** A callback called before the process is forked.
** Used to parse arguments, check options and pop their arguments, and set the
** builtin status (p->bltin_status).
** The builtin status may be used to display errors and to give up behaviors
** that may appear during the other callbacks.
** `BLTIN_CB_EXEC`
** A callback called within the child process.
** It has no effect on the parent but should be used to display errors and set
** the exit status.
** If this callback does not exit, the function `proc_launch` may execute
** the `execve(2)` with `p->argv` and `p->envp`.
** `BLTIN_CB_AFTER`
** A callback called ONLY within the last process of a job, after the job has
** completed.
** It may for example change the environment of the Shell or change the
** current directory.
